Hello Sai,

Thanks so much for your help.

Actually for me the kernel does not boot. It stuck in bootloader, with
"valid dtb not found".
I did not debug it further.
Anyways, we can look into this issue later.

Yes, these are generic API, and I don't expect any changes in here.
We don't have this issue in another SOC 4.9 kernel.
Also I compared these APIs with mainline and there is no major changes here.
This is just one example.
This sleep issue is happening from other places as well.
May be one common similarity may be: during task loading, or switching.

We observed that this issue is happening in normal sdm845 kernel as
well (without ipipe/xenomai patches applied in another branch).
Another point is, we don't see this issue in another arm64 target such
as hikey, with same 4.9 kernel.

hmmm. This will be little tough.
I will try to find sometime to point the exact cause, and share findings here.
Currently, I am debugging another issue.

Thanks for your help.
