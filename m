Yes. I'm currently doing a slight update to liburcu master branch to
allow urcu_bp_register_thread() calls to invoke urcu_bp_register() if
the thread is not registered yet. This seems more expected than implementing
urcu_bp_register_thread() as a no-op.

If you care about older liburcu versions, you will want to stick to use
rcu read lock/unlock pairs or rcu_read_ongoing to initialize urcu-bp, but
with future liburcu versions, urcu_bp_register_thread() will be another
option. See:

I'm talking about a real in-kernel IPI (as in inter-processor interrupt).
However, the way sys_membarrier detects which CPUs should receive that IPI
is by iterating on all cpu runqueues, and figure out which CPU is currently
running a thread which uses the same mm as the sys_membarrier caller
(for the PRIVATE membarrier commands).

So I suspect that the Xenomai thread is really not within the Linux scheduler
runqueue when it runs.

Very good then!
