Who is we? Do you plan to add automatic support at xenomai mainline?

But yes, some setup is likely needed if one wants to use lttng

Not POSIX, some inter-thread interrupts. point is the syscall waits
for the set of
registered *running* Linux threads. I doubt Xenomai threads can be reached that
way, the shadow Linux thread will be idle and it won't block.
I dont think its worth extending this syscall (seems rather dangerous actually,
given that I had some deadlocks with other "lazy schemes", see below)

Yes, and that gave me a deadlock already, if a library us not compiled
for Xenomai,
it will either use the syscall (and you detect that immediatly) or it
will work most of the time,
and lock up once in a while if a Linux thread took the "writer lock"
of the VDSO structures
and your high priority xenomai thread is busy waiting infinitely.

Only sane approach would be to use either the xenomai function directly,
or recreate the function (rdtsc + interpolation on x86).
Either compiling/patching lttng for Cobalt (which I really would not
want to do) or using a
clock plugin.
If the later is supposed to be minimal, then that would mean I would
have to get the
interpolation factors cobalt uses (without bringing in libcobalt).

Btw. the Xenomai and Linux monotonic clocks arent synchronised at all
AFAIK, so timestamps will
be different to the rest of Linux.
On my last plattform I did some tracing using internal stamp and
regulary wrote a
block with internal and external timestamps so those could be
converted "offline".
Anything similar with lttng or tools handling the traces?
