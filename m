An easy to use, consistent clock between Linux and Xenomai? Should be
the ultimate goal.
But I think its way less intrusive to just make the existing vDSO read/writes
safe by using the same scheme of atomic modification-count +
alternating buffers.

The vDSO is weird anyway, CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW was missing for a long
time (or still is?).
