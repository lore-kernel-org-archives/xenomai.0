The idea it to build the lttng plugin from the same code,
just using the things that are necessary for reading the monotonic clock

Linux CLOCK_MONOTONIC is skew corrected to increment at the same rate as
CLOCK_REALTIME.
You might have a chance with Linux CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW,
if you use the identical scaling method.

It might offer alot flexibility you don't get otherwise (without a ton of work).
