Unfortunately, the patch is white space mangled. Please use
git-send-email or tune your mail client not to break lines, etc.

I think the preferred coding style for Xenomai nowadays is the Linux
one. Therefore please use *tabs*" for indention (even if old RTCAN code
doesn't). This should also make checkpatch.pl even more happier.

Could you mention them in the Kconfig help? Just in case you know the
names of these devices.

Should not be a real problem.

As you might have realized, there is some interest on a RTCAN Flexcan
driver, which I'm currently working on. Hope to have something ready
this or next week. The same for publishing my rt_imx_uart driver.
