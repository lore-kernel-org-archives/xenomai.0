In the case of membarrier, IPIs are only sent to CPUs which runqueues
show that the currently running thread belongs to the same process
(for the PRIVATE command). So in this case we would not be sending
any IPI to the cores running Xenomai threads.

Ah, yes, read seqlock can be tricky in that kind of scenario indeed.

Then what we'd need is the nmi-safe monotonic clock that went into the
Linux kernel a while ago. It's called "monotonic fast", but really what
it does is to remove the need to use a read-seqlock. AFAIK it's not
exposed through the vDSO at the moment though.

Thanks,

Mathieu
