Just a small clarification: the PRIVATE membarrier command does not *wait*
for other threads, but it rather ensures that all other running threads
have had IPIs that issue memory barriers before it returns.

This is just a building block that can be used to speed up stuff like liburcu
and JIT memory reclaim.

Can a Xenomai thread issue clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) ?

AFAIK we don't have tooling to do what you describe out of the box,
but it could probably be implemented as a babeltrace 2 filter plugin.
